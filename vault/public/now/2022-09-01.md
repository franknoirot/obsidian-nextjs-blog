title: Learning to grieve

My grandfather passed away last month. I have been unusually lucky to have avoided direct experience of death well past the age when most people do, so this is my first relative to pass on on either side of my large family. My friend Chris Picot passed away suddenly earlier this summer, so this year is taking the shape of sorrow. I only include this in my life updates because I believe this year will shape how I approach the rest I am able to be a part of.

Chris and Pappy would have agreed on basically nothing about the world, but I like to think they would have had a fun time talking to each other. They both had an exceptional charm and sense of jocular humor, both truly expansive personalities. They would have insulted each other and been belly laughing.
