title: Leaving netamorphosis, joining Shift Lab
---
I've decided to move on from Netamorphosis to join Shift Lab as a Product Manager. Neta gave me many opportunities and empowered me to grow more than I ever expected to when I moved to New York without a job in August of 2019. I felt I had to move on because in just 2.5 years I had become the 4th most senior person at the company, and there was a culture change that needed to happen that I didn't feel capable of helping along in my role. I know the neta team will continue to create exceptional work, as they're stocked with some of the most talented and hard-working people I have ever had the pleasure of working with. 

I'm excited for the dev-focused culture that I have seen at Shift Lab, as well as a keen awareness that content is almost always the blocker which leads them to emphasize getting the shape of content and the editing experience for it scaffolded as quickly as possible. This was a philosophy that I really appreciated at neta and hope to sharpen further to get stuff built *ahead* of schedule.
