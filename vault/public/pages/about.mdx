metaDescription: About Frank Noirot – Product Manager, developer, and city nerd.
---
I’m a Product Manager, a developer, and a city nerd. I’m on the web to try to build collaborative tools that make us more generous and empathetic with each other.

PS my legal name is currently Frank Johnson but that’s a different story.

## Background
I was born outside of Akron, Ohio, a small city a bit south of the Great Lakes in the United States. I now live in the Upper West Side of New York City.

## Web design and engineering
I work as a Product Manager at [Shift Lab](https://shiftlab.co/). I love the web. I can't overstate how important I think it is, not only as a communication tool, but as a way of thinking and of treating each other. I don't think the web is quite in our bloodstream as a society yet. Everything else I'm learning professionally is to support building better platforms on the web.
