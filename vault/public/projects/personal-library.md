I built a personal library site that could be edited and published from a Google Sheet, and supported search and theme switching. I'm pretty proud of it as a standalone project, but it fell short of my end goal to create a tool to make it easy for my friends to make their own library websites.

I still want to do that someday, which is why I was so reinvigorated to come across Maggie Appleton's post on the same topic, that I was inspired to [[interoperable-libraries|write down some thoughts in response]].
